    "A data set (or dataset) is a collection of data. In the case of tabular data, a data set corresponds to one or more database tables, where every **column** of a table represents a particular **variable**, and each **row** corresponds to a given **record of the data** set in question. The data set lists values for each of the variables, such as for example height and weight of an object, for each member of the data set. Data sets can also consist of a collection of documents or files\n",

    "Several characteristics define a data set's structure and properties. These include the number and types of the attributes or variables, and various statistical measures applicable to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values may be **numbers**, such as real numbers or integers, for example representing a person's height in centimeters, but may also be **nominal** data (i.e., not consisting of numerical values), for example representing a person's ethnicity. More generally, values may be of any of the kinds described as a level of measurement.\n",

    "\n",
    "These data consist of *audio, images, symbols, or text*. The gender of a person, i.e., male, female, or others, is qualitative data.\n",

    "**Numerical Variables Distribution: `Age`**\n",

    "To understand the spread and shape of the data, we visualize the distribution of the Age feature using a histogram combined with a Kernel Density Estimate (KDE):\n",

    "- The histogram shows how passenger ages are distributed across intervals. It highlights concentrations of values — for example, many passengers appear to be between 20 and 40 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The KDE curve (in red) offers a smooth approximation of the underlying distribution. Unlike the rigid bins of a histogram, KDE helps us see the overall shape and continuity of the data — such as skewness or multiple peaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This kind of plot is valuable for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying common age ranges\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detecting skewed distributions or multi-modal trends\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spotting areas where data is sparse, which may influence model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identifying potential outliers or unusual age distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining histogram and KDE, we get both discrete and continuous perspectives on the same feature, making it easier to decide on transformations (e.g., normalization, binning) or whether age should be treated differently in model pipelines."

    "In descriptive statistics, a box plot or boxplot is a method for demonstrating graphically the locality, spread and skewness groups of numerical data through their quartiles.\n",
    "In addition to the box on a box plot, there can be lines (which are called whiskers) extending from the box indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles.\n",
    "Outliers that differ significantly from the rest of the dataset may be plotted as individual points beyond the whiskers on the box-plot. Box plots are non-parametric: they display variation in samples of a statistical population without making any assumptions of the underlying statistical distribution.\n",

    "**Elements of Box Plot**\n",
    "\n",
    "A box plot gives a five-number summary of a set of data which is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Minimum – It is the minimum value in the dataset excluding the outliers.\n",
    "- First Quartile (Q1) – 25% of the data lies below the First (lower) Quartile.\n",
    "- Median (Q2) – It is the mid-point of the dataset. Half of the values lie below it and half above.\n",
    "- Third Quartile (Q3) – 75% of the data lies below the Third (Upper) Quartile.\n",
    "- Maximum – It is the maximum value in the dataset excluding the outliers.\n",

    "![types-of-data-img](img/boxplot_example.jpg)\n",

    "\n",
    "The area inside the box (50% of the data) is known as the Inter Quartile Range. The IQR is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$IQR = Q3-Q1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Outlies are the data points below and above the lower and upper limit. The lower and upper limit is calculated as:\n",

    "$Lower Limit = Q1 - 1.5*IQR$\n",
    "\n",
    "$Upper Limit = Q3 + 1.5*IQR$\n",
    "\n",
    "The values below and above these limits are considered outliers and the minimum and maximum values are calculated from the points which lie under the lower and upper limit.\n",

Variables with very high positive or negative correlations (e.g., above 0.7 or below -0.7) may indicate redundancy or multicollinearity, which can affect model performance.

    "## Exploring Feature Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "Before performing any advanced analysis or modeling, it is essential to explore and understand the underlying structure of the dataset. One fundamental tool for this process is the <code>[DataFrame.groupby()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html)</code> function in the pandas library, which allows for the aggregation and summarization of data based on one or more categorical features. By grouping data, we can uncover patterns, compare subsets, and derive meaningful insights that would otherwise remain hidden in raw tables. The following exercises are designed to develop familiarity with <code>[DataFrame.groupby()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html)</code> operations and demonstrate how systematic data exploration leads to a deeper understanding of trends, distributions, and relationships within the data."

    "\n",
    "Pandas <code>[DataFrame.groupby()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html)</code> function is a powerful tool used to split a DataFrame into groups based on one or more columns, allowing for efficient data analysis and aggregation. It follows a “split-apply-combine” strategy, where data is divided into groups, a function is applied to each group, and the results are combined into a new DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The groupby() function in Pandas involves three main steps: Splitting, Applying, and Combining.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Splitting: This step involves dividing the DataFrame into groups based on some criteria. The groups are defined by unique values in one or more columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Applying: In this step, a function is applied to each group independently. You can apply various functions to each group, such as:\n",
    "    - Aggregation: Calculate summary statistics (e.g., sum, mean, count) for each group.\n",
    "    - Transformation: Modify the values within each group.\n",
    "    - Filtering: Keep or discard groups based on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",

The ship's design placed first-class accommodations closer to the lifeboats, facilitating quicker access during the evacuation. Additionally, third-class passengers faced physical barriers and lacked clear guidance, which hindered their ability to reach lifeboats in time. These structural and procedural disadvantages underscore how deeply social hierarchies impacted survival outcomes during the tragedy.​"

    "It is not uncommon in real-world applications for our samples to be missing one or more values for various reasons. There could have been an error in the data collection process, certain measurements are not applicable, or particular fields could have been simply left blank in a survey, for example. We typically see missing values as the blank spaces in our data table or as placeholder strings such as NaN, which stands for not a number, or NULL (a commonly used indicator of unknown values in relational databases).\n",

    "Unfortunately, most computational tools are unable to handle such missing values, or produce unpredictable results if we simply ignore them. Therefore, it is crucial that we take care of those missing values before we proceed with further analyses. In this section, we will work through several practical techniques for dealing with missing values by removing entries from our dataset or imputing missing values from other samples and features.\n",

    "**Feature scaling** is an important step in the preprocessing pipeline for many machine learning models, even though some algorithms, like decision trees and random forests, do not require it. These models are \"scale invariant,\" meaning that the performance of the algorithm does not change with different feature scales. However, many other machine learning algorithms benefit from feature scaling because their performance can be affected by the differences in the magnitude of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the significance of feature scaling, let's take a look at two concrete examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Gradient Descent (Linear Regression or Logistic Regression)\n",
    "Imagine you are working with a dataset that includes two features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feature 1 (Income): Ranges from 10,000 to 100,000 (in dollars).\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feature 2 (Age): Ranges from 18 to 70 (in years).\n",
    "\n",
    "    When you use gradient descent to minimize the cost function (e.g., mean squared error), the algorithm adjusts weights based on the features. If the income feature has values that are much larger than the age feature, the model will tend to focus more on optimizing the weight of the income feature because the numerical range of income is much larger. As a result, the model may not learn as effectively from the age feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If both features were scaled to have a similar range (e.g., between 0 and 1 or with a standard deviation of 1), the gradient descent algorithm would update both weights more evenly, leading to a more balanced and effective model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)\n",
    "    Consider a dataset with the following two features:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feature 1 (Distance to school): Ranges from 0 to 5 kilometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Feature 2 (Annual salary): Ranges from 20,000 to 200,000 (in dollars).\n",
    "\n",
    "    When using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) with the Euclidean distance metric to classify or predict, the distances between samples are calculated based on the features. However, the distance calculation involves squaring the differences of each feature's value, and the larger the feature's range, the more influence it has on the final distance. In this case, the salary feature will dominate the distance calculation because its range is much larger than that of the distance to school feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "    For example, if two data points differ significantly in salary but have very similar distances to school, the KNN algorithm might incorrectly assign a higher weight to the salary difference due to its larger scale, making the distance metric less representative of the actual similarities between data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If both features were scaled to the same range, the distance between samples would be influenced equally by both features, leading to more accurate classifications or predictions."

    "Now, there are two common approaches to bring different features onto the same scale: **normalization** and **standardization**. Those terms are often used quite loosely in different fields, and the meaning has to be derived from the context. Most often, **normalization** refers to the rescaling of the features to a range of \\([0, 1]\\), which is a special case of **min-max scaling**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To normalize our data, we can simply apply the min-max scaling to each feature column, where the new value of a sample can be calculated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$X_{\\text{normalized}} = \\frac{X - X_{\\text{min}}}{X_{\\text{max}} - X_{\\text{min}}}$\n",
    "\n",

    "- $X_{\\text{normalized}}$ is the normalized value of the feature.\n",

    "Although normalization via min-max scaling is a commonly used technique that is useful when we need values in a bounded interval, **standardization** can be more practical for many machine learning algorithms, especially for optimization algorithms such as gradient descent. The reason is that many linear models initialize the weights to 0 or small random values close to 0. Using standardization, we center the feature columns at a mean of 0 with a standard deviation of 1, so that the feature columns take the form of a normal distribution, which makes it easier to learn the weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, standardization maintains useful information about outliers and makes the algorithm less sensitive to them, in contrast to min-max scaling, which scales the data to a limited range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure for **standardization** can be expressed by the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$X_{\\text{standardized}} = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $X_{\\text{standardized}}$ is the standardized value of the feature.\n",

Managing these steps efficiently and ensuring reproducibility can be challenging.

It allows you to chain together multiple steps, such as data transformations and model training, into a single, cohesive process.
